  - `show_pdf_viewer()`: Displays the PDF document

## State Management

- [frontend/state.py](mdc:frontend/state.py): Manages application state using Streamlit's session state:
  - `initialize_session_state()`: Sets up default state values
  - `handle_file_change()`: Responds to file upload changes
