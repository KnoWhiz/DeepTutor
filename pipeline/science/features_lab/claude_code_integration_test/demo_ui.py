    1. **Get API Key**: Sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
    2. **Configure**: Edit `config.py` and add your Anthropic API key
    3. **Run**: Use `python run_chatbot.py` or `streamlit run claude_code_integration_test.py`
    
    ### üìã Features:
    - **Multi-file Analysis**: Processes entire directories of documents
    - **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation context across exchanges
    - **Deep Analysis**: Provides comprehensive responses with citations
    - **File Type Support**: .txt, .md, .py, .js, .json, .yaml files

**üß¨ Psychological Classification (from HiTOP paper)**:
- Hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology
- Dimensional approaches to mental health classification
- Alternative frameworks to traditional diagnostic systems
- Statistical modeling of psychological disorders

**üîó Cross-Document Themes**:
- Systematic approaches to complex problem solving
- Framework development and validation
- Evidence-based methodological improvements
- Integration of theoretical and practical considerations

- **Prompting Techniques**: Advanced prompt engineering for language models
- **Statistical Modeling**: Factor analysis and hierarchical modeling approaches
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Comprehensive metrics and benchmark comparisons

**üèóÔ∏è Framework Development**:
- **Systematic Integration**: Combining multiple approaches into unified frameworks
- **Iterative Refinement**: Progressive improvement through testing and validation
- **Cross-domain Application**: Testing methods across different application areas

- **Generate reasoning traces** to induce, track, and update action plans
- **Perform actions** to interface with external information sources
- **Handle exceptions** and adapt plans dynamically

**üéØ Key Innovations**:
- **Synergistic Design**: Reasoning helps with planning, while actions provide additional context
- **Interpretability**: Human-readable reasoning traces improve transparency
- **Robustness**: Better handling of hallucination and error propagation

**üìà Performance Results**:
- HotpotQA and Fever: Overcomes hallucination issues in chain-of-thought reasoning
- ALFWorld and WebShop: 34% and 10% improvement over imitation/RL methods
- Achieved with minimal examples (1-2 in-context demonstrations)

- **Integration over separation**: Both argue for combining previously separate elements

**üß© Problem-Solving Philosophy**:
- **Systematic decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable components
- **Evidence-based validation**: Extensive empirical testing across multiple domains
- **Practical applicability**: Focus on real-world implementation and utility

**üìö Theoretical Contributions**:
- Both challenge existing paradigms (traditional prompting vs. traditional diagnostic categories)

- **Provide specific citations** and quotes from your files
- **Draw connections** between different parts of your codebase
- **Offer detailed analysis** based on the actual content

1. Set up your Anthropic API key in `config.py`
