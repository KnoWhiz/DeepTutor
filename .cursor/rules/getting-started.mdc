# Getting Started with DeepTutor

This guide helps new developers set up and understand the DeepTutor project.

## Installation

1. Create and activate a Python environment:
```bash
conda create --name deeptutor python=3.12
conda activate deeptutor
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install AgentChat and OpenAI client from Extensions
pip install -U "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]"
# Install AutoGen Studio for no-code GUI
pip install -U "autogenstudio"
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with required API keys and configurations.
   See [README.md](mdc:README.md) for the required environment variables.

2. For local development, set `ENVIRONMENT="local"` to skip authentication.

## Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
python -m streamlit run tutor.py
```

## Common Issues

- PyMuPDF installation may require downloading a platform-specific wheel
- Check your Python version with `python -V`
- Place the wheel file at the root directory and install with `pip install PyMuPDF-<...>.whl`

## Key Files for Development

- [tutor.py](mdc:tutor.py): Main entry point
- [frontend/ui.py](mdc:frontend/ui.py): UI components
- [frontend/state.py](mdc:frontend/state.py): State management
- [pipeline/science/pipeline/session_manager.py](mdc:pipeline/science/pipeline/session_manager.py): Chat session handling
