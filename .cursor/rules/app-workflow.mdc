# Application Workflow

DeepTutor follows a specific workflow for document processing and interaction:

## Initialization Flow

1. The application starts from [tutor.py](mdc:tutor.py)
2. Page configuration and UI setup via `setup_page_config()`
3. Authentication check through `show_auth()` (can be skipped in development)
4. Session state initialization 

## Document Processing Flow

1. User uploads PDF file(s) via `show_file_upload()`
2. File change is detected and handled by `handle_file_change()`
3. PDF is processed using `state_process_pdf_file()`
4. Document content is extracted and embedded
5. UI displays the PDF viewer and chat interface

## Chat Interaction Flow

1. User enters a question about the document
2. In Basic/Advanced modes:
   - Document context is retrieved based on the question
   - AI reasoning is processed through multiple phases
   - Response is formatted and displayed
3. In Lite mode:
   - Simpler processing for faster responses
4. Response is displayed in the chat interface
5. Sources and explanations are provided when available

## Mode Differences

- **Lite**: Fastest mode, raw text processing only
- **Basic**: Standard mode with markdown extraction, image understanding, and deeper reasoning
- **Advanced**: Enhanced mode with GraphRAG for better document understanding
