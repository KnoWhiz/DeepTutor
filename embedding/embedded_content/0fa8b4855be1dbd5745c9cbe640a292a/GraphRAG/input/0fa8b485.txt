### **Introduction**

The term "gacha" denotes a gaming mechanic prevalent in online and mobile games, wherein players acquire virtual items, characters, or rewards through a randomized process often tied to in-game purchases. This system involves players using virtual or real currency to access virtual loot boxes, capsules, or similar containers, with the contents being generated randomly. The term is derived from the Japanese "gachapon," referring to vending machine capsules containing toys. Gacha games constitute a notable subgenre, recognized for their chance-based monetization model and the collection of virtual items.

However, knowing the word "gacha" has been controversial in most cases. Many players have been avoiding the game with in-game chances due to the risk of spending their money for the dopamine they get from obtaining a rare item. Here is the list of reasons why gacha games have been avoided. Randomized Monetization Model, the core mechanic of gacha games involves a randomized system for obtaining in-game items or characters. This randomness can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players who may spend money without guarantee of receiving

desired rewards. Addictive Nature, the excitement and unpredictability of the gacha system can contribute to addictive behaviors, with players compelled to make repeated purchases in the hope of obtaining rare or desired virtual items. This has raised concerns about the potential for excessive spending and its impact on vulnerable individuals. Youth Appeal and Regulation, gacha games often attract a younger audience due to their colorful graphics, engaging characters, and accessible gameplay. This has led to concerns about the potential for children to engage in ingame purchases without proper understanding, prompting calls for stricter regulations. Comparisons to Gambling, the randomized nature of gacha draws parallels to gambling, where players invest money with uncertain outcomes. Critics argue that this resemblance raises ethical concerns, especially considering that some players may develop addictive patterns similar to gambling addiction. Loot Box Controversy, gacha draws are akin to loot boxes, which have faced scrutiny worldwide. Some countries and jurisdictions have implemented or considered regulations to address the potential harm associated with these chance-based microtransactions. Exclusivity and Power Disparities, gacha games often introduce rare or powerful characters/items that are difficult to obtain without significant investment. This creates a disparity between players who spend money and those who do not, leading to concerns about fairness and a "pay-to-win" dynamic. Incomplete Information, Some gacha games may not provide clear information about the odds of obtaining specific items or characters, contributing to a lack of transparency. This lack of clarity can lead to players feeling misled or exploited. Regulatory Responses, governments and regulatory bodies in various countries have responded to concerns about gacha mechanics by considering or implementing regulations to protect consumers, particularly minors, from potential harm associated with these chance-based transactions.

While gacha games continue to be popular, the controversy surrounding them has prompted discussions about responsible game design, ethical considerations, and the need for industry regulations to address the potential negative impacts on players. Even then, gacha games have witnessed remarkable success and continue to captivate a large and diverse player base. The list of gacha games is as follows ; AzurLane, Fate/GO, Honkai Impact, Arknights, Blue Archive, Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and many more.

To unravel the mysteries of this success and to assess its link to user satisfaction, this research employs the DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model, adapted for qualitative data analysis. With the title of "Success Throughout Gacha Game Satisfaction by using D&M Model from Students in Batam". By employing the DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model, this research aims to contribute valuable insights into the success and satisfaction dynamics within the Gacha gaming industry, particularly from the perspective of students in Batam, Indonesia.

# **Analysis Data Method**

## **Outliner**

Is a condition of a data that's different with other data in order to have different attribute with structural data and if happens to be outliner then the survey must be erased from the data by knowing conversion to (z-table) and if calculation succeeded within the score ≤ -3 between ≥ 3, then this survey must be erased because it becomes "outliner"

## **Validity**

Is a test that's used to measure and know if the data is valid or not. The way to test is by correlation with each point and factor as they called Bivariate Pearson. Then for knowing data that's valid, if the coefficient correlation result must be > 0.05 then it's confirmed valid.

## **Reliability**

Is a test for measuring how reliable the data is or not. This test is using the alpha cronbach formula, for reliability percentage. With an alpha cronbach score > 0.5 to 0.7, can be confirmed that the data is reliable or moderate reliability. And if the score is above 0.7 to 0.9, it can be called as high reliability.

#### **Regression Test**

Is a part of SPSS Statistic analysis in order to determine the significance of each variable, whether independent and dependent has significance to each other or individual, and connecting the model to the phenomena.

#### **Results**

Within the result that has been collected from the questionnaire by 300 respondents, then next step the data sample will be tested with an outliner and deciding if the data must be erased from the questionnaire.
