# DeepTutor Project Overview

DeepTutor is an AI-powered PDF document analysis and tutoring application built with Streamlit. It allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with their contents through a chat interface.

## Main Components

- **Entry Point**: The main application starts at [tutor.py](mdc:tutor.py), which sets up the Streamlit interface and handles file uploading and processing.

- **Frontend**: The UI components and state management are in the [frontend/](mdc:frontend) directory:
  - [frontend/ui.py](mdc:frontend/ui.py): Contains the UI components for the application
  - [frontend/state.py](mdc:frontend/state.py): Manages application state and session variables
  - [frontend/utils.py](mdc:frontend/utils.py): Helper functions for the frontend
  - [frontend/auth.py](mdc:frontend/auth.py): Authentication functionality

- **Pipeline**: The backend processing logic is in the [pipeline/](mdc:pipeline) directory:
  - Document processing and embedding
  - Chat session management
  - AI reasoning and response generation

## Key Features

- Multiple modes (Lite, Basic, Advanced) for different levels of document processing
- Multi-language support
- PDF viewing alongside chat interface
- Document chunking and embedding for efficient retrieval
- Contextual conversation history
