    "This is Image #1 / Fig.1 / Figure 1: \nFigure 1: Conversation example starter and reply <markdown>\nImage Analysis: ##Image Analysis:\n\nThe image presents a screenshot of a conversation between two individuals, with a focus on character interaction and personality analysis. The content is structured as a dialogue, with each participant's statements displayed in gray text boxes.\n\nThe top section of the image contains a description of a character named Asta, detailing her personality traits and background. This description is followed by a prompt to \"Start the conversation.\" Below this, a response from the user is shown, where they engage with Asta, referencing test results and initiating a discussion.\n\nThe subsequent sections display Asta's responses, attributed to \"(Jade),\" along with narrative descriptions of her actions and expressions. The conversation revolves around the user's accurate analysis of Asta's personality, which has piqued her interest.\n\nKey elements visible in the image include:\n\n1. Character description and background information\n2. Conversation dialogue between the user and Asta (Jade)\n3. Narrative descriptions of Asta's actions and expressions\n4. Gray text boxes used to display the conversation\n\nThe image appears to be a screenshot from an interactive story or character simulation, where the user's input influences the conversation and outcome. The level of detail in the character description and the narrative elements suggests a focus on storytelling and character development. \n\nNo graphs, diagrams, or other visual data representations are present in the image. The content is primarily textual, with a simple layout and minimal visual embellishments."

    "This is Image #2 / Fig.2 / Figure 2: \nFigure 2: The evaluation result of our model vs base model <markdown>\nImage Analysis: ##Image Analysis:\n\nThe image presents a radar chart comparing the performance of two models, labeled \"Baseline\" and \"Ours,\" across various metrics. The chart is titled \"Radar Chart on Different Metrics Values.\"\n\n1. **Chart Structure:**\n   - The radar chart is circular, with multiple axes radiating from the center.\n   - Each axis represents a different metric.\n\n2. **Metrics:**\n   - The visible metrics are \"Personality,\" \"Hallucination,\" and \"Stability.\"\n   - There are additional metrics represented by axes, but their labels are not fully visible.\n\n3. **Data Representation:**\n   - The \"Baseline\" model is represented by a blue line and shaded area.\n   - The \"Ours\" model is represented by an orange line and shaded area.\n   - The values for each metric are plotted on the respective axes, and the points are connected to form a polygon for each model.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - The chart allows for a visual comparison of the two models across the different metrics.\n   - The \"Ours\" model generally has higher or comparable values than the \"Baseline\" model across the visible metrics.\n\n5. **Scale:**\n   - The chart includes concentric circles indicating the scale, with values ranging from 0 to 8.\n   - The exact scale values are not labeled on all circles, but the visible numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n6. **Legend:**\n   - A legend in the bottom-left corner distinguishes between the \"Baseline\" (blue) and \"Ours\" (orange) models.\n\n7. **Observations:**\n   - The \"Ours\" model appears to outperform or match the \"Baseline\" model in the metrics of \"Personality,\" \"Hallucination,\" and \"Stability.\"\n   - The chart suggests that \"Ours\" has a broader coverage or higher values across most of the metrics displayed.\n\nThe analysis is based solely on the visible information in the image, providing a factual description of the radar chart's content and structure."

    "This is Image #3 / Fig.3 / Figure 3: \nFigure 3: A typical conversation starter for interacting with LLMs <markdown>\nImage Analysis: ##Image Analysis:\n\nThe image depicts a screenshot of a conversation between two users, Gepard and Jingyuan, in a chat interface. The conversation is presented in a vertical format, with each user's message displayed in a gray text box.\n\nThe top message is from Gepard, whose username is accompanied by a profile picture and the label \"c.ai\". The message reads: \"Gepard noticed you approaching, he immediately straighten up and spoke with a solemn and firm tone. 'Good day, how can I help you?' He said while his eyes were scanning and observing your every move and expression.\"\n\nThe response from Jingyuan is displayed below Gepard's message, also with a profile picture and the label \"c.ai\". Jingyuan's message states: \"He is sipping his tea at his desk when he glances up at you, his eyes studying you with a thoughtful gaze. Ah, what a surprise... I was not expecting a visit today. What brings you here?\"\n\nThe background of the image is white, providing a clean and neutral backdrop for the conversation. The overall layout and design of the chat interface are simple and easy to follow, allowing the viewer to focus on the conversation between Gepard and Jingyuan."

    "This is Image #4 / Fig.4 / Figure 4: \nFigure 4: The scores of conversations for engagement for with and without events <markdown>\nImage Analysis: ##Image Analysis:\n\nThe image presents a bar graph comparing the average engagement scores of conversations with and without events. The graph is titled \"Engagement Scores Comparison.\"\n\n1. The x-axis is labeled with two categories: \"Without Events\" and \"With Events.\"\n2. The y-axis is labeled \"Average Engagement Score\" and ranges from 70.0 to 90.0 in increments of 2.5.\n3. Two bars are displayed:\n   - The left bar, colored light blue, represents \"Without Events\" and has an average engagement score of 83.55 \u00b1 3.87.\n   - The right bar, colored light green, represents \"With Events\" and has an average engagement score of 84.50 \u00b1 2.20.\n4. Error bars are visible above each bar, indicating the range of scores.\n\nThe graph illustrates a comparison between the average engagement scores of conversations with and without events, showing a slightly higher average score for conversations with events."
