### 💡 Key Takeaway
🌟 **Incorporating** **event-driven prompts** and **character-specific fine-tuning** into anime chatbots like HonkaiChat leads to **more engaging, natural, and contextually grounded conversations** while **reducing hallucinations** compared to static, reactive systems.

### 📚 Document Overview
- **Event-driven prompts** enable chatbots to reference dynamic, character-specific events, making conversations feel more natural and engaging.
- **Fine-tuning on character data** and using curated scenarios helps the model mimic unique personalities and reduce irrelevant hallucinations.
- **Evaluation with GPT-4** shows that event-based systems improve conversational quality compared to static, context-reactive approaches.
- **Future work** aims to enhance personality diversity and automate event integration for even more lifelike role-playing agents.

### 🔧 Event-Driven Dialogue Framework
- The framework enhances chatbot conversations by embedding dynamic **events** and character-specific experiences, making interactions feel more lifelike and engaging.
- By fine-tuning models with **event-based prompts** and rich character data, the system reduces **hallucinations** and improves conversational **naturalness** compared to static, reactive bots.
- Evaluations using **GPT-4** show that event-driven approaches lead to more **contextual** and emotionally aligned responses, especially in fantasy role-playing settings like Honkai: Star Rail.

### 📊 Data Collection and Augmentation
- The process involved extracting in-game dialogues and lore from the **Honkai: Star Rail Wiki** and generating synthetic conversations, resulting in a rich dataset of over **5,000 samples**.
- Techniques like **character name masking** and **dialogue synthesis** were used to diversify scenarios and ensure the chatbot responds naturally to a wide range of events.

### 🤖 Model Training and Fine-Tuning
- The process involves pre-training a large language model (like **LLaMA 3.1-8B**) on broad game and character data to give it foundational knowledge.
- The model is then adapted to specific characters by training on curated dialogues and **event-driven scenarios**, making responses more engaging and lifelike.
- Using **metrics** like memorization, personality, and hallucination rates, the team showed that fine-tuned, event-driven models create more natural and context-aware conversations.

### 📊 Evaluation and Results
- **Event-driven prompts** led to more **engaging** and **natural conversations**, with models showing improved alignment to character personality and context.
- The approach **reduced hallucinations** and encouraged **contextual emotional responses**, as measured by multi-dimensional GPT-4 ratings across $N = 200$ test samples.

### 🔍 Analysis and Future Directions
- **Event-driven prompts** reduce generic hallucinations and enable more **contextual, emotionally aligned responses**, making chatbots feel more "alive."
- Future work will focus on **improving character-specific personality** and **streamlining event pipelines** to achieve richer, more authentic conversations.
